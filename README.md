# Pin Items Mod

[中文说明 / Chinese README](README_zh-CN.md)

![Preview](./PinItems/release_extra/preview.png)

A small quality-of-life mod that lets you pin item types so they refuse to auto-stash when you hit Store All.

Features

- Pin a favorite bullet, tool, or med once and every copy of that model stays in your backpack on Store All.
- Keep your go-to loadout intact without fishing it back out of the stash after every raid.
- Pins survive manual moves—shuffle gear around however you like without losing your “keep” list.

Usage

- Open your backpack or Storage.
- Select an item model you always want on hand.
- Hit the big shiny Pin option (right-click menu) to toggle it.
- When you press Store All, pinned item types remain on you while everything else stacks neatly away.
- You can still drag or double-click pinned items to send them into Storage manually whenever you really want to move them.

Differences between Pinning and Locking (the L key)

- Pinning applies to the item type, not the slot, so future copies of that gear stay protected automatically.
- Pins don’t interfere with sorting; they simply block Store All from dumping your favorites.
- The pin button lives in the item menu and is hard to miss.
- Pinning does not conflict with Locking(the L key), you can use them both at the same time!

Enjoy smoother inventory management with way less stash juggling.
